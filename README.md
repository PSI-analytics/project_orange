## Overview

The purpose of this project is to deliver a scope of work for the Saudi Pro League. This was done together with PwC
where Prospect was looking at the impact of attendance and viewership and the impact of moving to a closed league.

This project has been split into the following pipelines:
* model_generation: Training of a predicted attendance and viewership model
* model_prediction: Using both models to make predictions for various commercial scenarios
* model_preprocessing: Cleaning and feature engineering of the dataset

Any questions about the project get in touch with Zubin (zr@prospectsportinginsights.co.uk).

Project should be run using `python 3.10`

To create environment to run the project use the following commands:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The project uses the Prospect package which is not publicly available so to install the Prospect package use the below
command

```
pip install git+https://github.com/PSI-analytics/prospect_package@0.1.8
```

## Rules and guidelines

In order to get the best out of the template:

* Don't remove any lines from the `.gitignore` file we provide
* Make sure your results can be reproduced by following a [data engineering convention](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/faq/faq.html#what-is-data-engineering-convention)
* Don't commit data to your repository
* Don't commit any credentials or your local configuration to your repository. Keep all your credentials and local configuration in `conf/local/`

## How to install dependencies

Declare any dependencies in `requirements.txt` for `pip` installation.

To install them, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run your Kedro pipeline

You can run your Kedro project with:

```
kedro run
```

## How to test your Kedro project

Have a look at the files `tests/test_run.py` and `tests/pipelines/data_science/test_pipeline.py` for instructions on how to write your tests. Run the tests as follows:

```
pytest
```

You can configure the coverage threshold in your project's `pyproject.toml` file under the `[tool.coverage.report]` section.

## Project dependencies

To see and update the dependency requirements for your project use `requirements.txt`. You can install the project requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## How to work with Kedro and notebooks

> Note: Using `kedro jupyter` or `kedro ipython` to run your notebook provides these variables in scope: `catalog`, `context`, `pipelines` and `session`.
>
> Jupyter, JupyterLab, and IPython are already included in the project requirements by default, so once you have run `pip install -r requirements.txt` you will not need to take any extra steps before you use them.

### Jupyter
To use Jupyter notebooks in your Kedro project, you need to install Jupyter:

```
pip install jupyter
```

After installing Jupyter, you can start a local notebook server:

```
kedro jupyter notebook
```

### JupyterLab
To use JupyterLab, you need to install it:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

You can also start JupyterLab:

```
kedro jupyter lab
```

### IPython
And if you want to run an IPython session:

```
kedro ipython
```

### How to ignore notebook output cells in `git`
To automatically strip out all output cell contents before committing to `git`, you can use tools like [`nbstripout`](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout). For example, you can add a hook in `.git/config` with `nbstripout --install`. This will run `nbstripout` before anything is committed to `git`.

> *Note:* Your output cells will be retained locally.
